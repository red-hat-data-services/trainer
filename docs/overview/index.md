# Overview

Kubeflow Trainer is a **Kubernetes-native distributed AI platform** for scalable large language model (LLM) fine-tuning and training of AI models across a wide range of frameworks, including PyTorch, MLX, HuggingFace, DeepSpeed, JAX, XGBoost, and more.

## What is Kubeflow Trainer?

Kubeflow Trainer brings **MPI to Kubernetes** for multi-node, multi-GPU distributed jobs across HPC clusters. It integrates seamlessly with the Cloud Native AI ecosystem through tools like:

- **[Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/)** for topology-aware scheduling and multi-cluster dispatch
- **[JobSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset)** and **[LeaderWorkerSet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws)** for orchestration
- **[Coscheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/blob/master/pkg/coscheduling/README.md)** for gang scheduling with the Kubernetes scheduler
- **[Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/)** for batch scheduling
- **[YuniKorn](https://yunikorn.apache.org/docs/)** for resource optimization
- **[KAI Scheduler](https://github.com/NVIDIA/KAI-Scheduler)** for GPU-aware gang scheduling

The platform features **distributed data caching** using [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) for zero-copy tensor streaming directly to GPU nodes, maximizing training performance.

## Why Use Kubeflow Trainer?

### Simple, Scalable, and Built for LLM Fine-Tuning

Train models with a **single Kubernetes CRD** (TrainJob) across any supported framework. Scale from single-GPU workloads to massive multi-node distributed training with minimal code changes.

### Extensible and Portable

Run anywhere: **public clouds, on-premises, or hybrid environments**. The plugin-based architecture allows custom ML policies, runtimes, and schedulers to be added without modifying the core platform.

### Distributed AI Data Caching

Optimize data loading with **Apache Arrow** and **Apache DataFusion** for high-performance, zero-copy tensor streaming. The distributed cache reduces training time by eliminating data loading bottlenecks.

### LLM Fine-Tuning Blueprints

Pre-built templates for **generative AI fine-tuning** with TorchTune, supporting popular models like Llama and Qwen. Configuration-driven workflows eliminate boilerplate code.

### Optimized GPU Efficiency

Intelligent data streaming and caching maximize **GPU utilization**, reducing training costs and time. Supports efficient model parallelism with PyTorch FSDP and DeepSpeed ZeRO.

### Native Kubernetes Integrations

Achieve optimal GPU utilization and coordinated scheduling for large-scale AI workloads.
Kubeflow Trainer seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes ecosystem projects like
[Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/),
[Coscheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/scheduler-plugins/blob/master/pkg/coscheduling/README.md),
[Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/), or [YuniKorn](https://yunikorn.apache.org/docs/).
