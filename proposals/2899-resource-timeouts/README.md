# KEP-2899: Add Resource Timeouts APIs to the Trainer

## Summary

Add lifecycle management fields to the Trainer APIs. For the Trainer v2.2 release, we will implement:

- **`ActiveDeadlineSeconds`** on `TrainJobSpec`: Allows data scientists to set maximum runtime for individual TrainJobs via the Kubeflow SDK.

This brings TrainJob lifecycle management in line with Kubernetes Jobs and JobSets.

## Motivation

Currently, `TrainJob` resources persist in the cluster indefinitely after completion unless manually deleted. This leads to:

- **Etcd Bloat:** Accumulation of stale metadata in the cluster state.
- **Resource Contention:** Runaway training jobs can consume GPU/CPU resources indefinitely if they hang or enter an infinite loop.
- **Operational Overhead:** Platform admins have no centralized way to enforce cleanup policies.

### Goals

- Add `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` to `TrainJobSpec` for data scientists to control individual job timeouts
- Expose `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` in the Kubeflow Python SDK for data scientists
- Follow Kubernetes Job/JobSet patterns and existing Trainer API conventions

### Non-Goals

- Automatically migrate existing TrainJobs to use new defaults
- Provide per-namespace TTL overrides

## Proposal

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a **Data Scientist**, I want to set a maximum runtime on my TrainJob so that a training job that hangs or diverges is automatically terminated after a specified duration, freeing up expensive GPU resources for other experiments.

#### Story 2

As a **Data Scientist**, I want to set a `activeDeadlineSeconds` via the Kubeflow Python SDK when submitting a training job from my notebook, so that I don't need to write or understand Kubernetes YAML to protect my experiment from running indefinitely.

```python
from kubeflow.trainer import TrainerClient, CustomTrainer, Initializer, HuggingFaceDatasetInitializer

TrainerClient().train(
    trainer=CustomTrainer(
        func=train_func,
        num_nodes=3,
    ),
    initializer=Initializer(
        model=HuggingFaceDatasetInitializer(storage_uri="hf://qwen3.2-instruct")
    ),
    activeDeadlineSeconds=28800,  # 8 hours max
)
```

## Design Details

### API Design

#### TrainJobSpec Changes

Add `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` to `TrainJobSpec` in `pkg/apis/trainer/v1alpha1/trainjob_types.go`:

```go
type TrainJobSpec struct {
    // ... existing fields ...

    // ActiveDeadlineSeconds specifies the duration in seconds relative to the TrainJob
    // start time (which resets on resume from suspension) that the TrainJob may be active
    // before the system tries to terminate it. Value must be a positive integer.
    // Once reached, all running Pods are terminated and the TrainJob status becomes
    // Failed with reason: DeadlineExceeded.
    // +optional
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:rule="self == oldSelf",message="field is immutable"
    ActiveDeadlineSeconds *int64 `json:"activeDeadlineSeconds,omitempty"`
}
```

#### New Condition Reason

Add new condition reason in `pkg/apis/trainer/v1alpha1/trainjob_types.go`:

```go
const (
    // TrainJobDeadlineExceededReason is the reason for the "Failed" condition
    // when ActiveDeadlineSeconds is exceeded.
    TrainJobDeadlineExceededReason string = "DeadlineExceeded"
)
```

When a TrainJob exceeds its `ActiveDeadlineSeconds`, the controller sets a `Failed` condition with `Reason: DeadlineExceeded`, matching the [Kubernetes Job behavior](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#job-termination-and-cleanup).

### Value Resolution

`ActiveDeadlineSeconds` is set directly on `TrainJobSpec` by the data scientist.

### User Examples

**TrainJob with Deadline (Data Scientist):**

```yaml
apiVersion: trainer.kubeflow.org/v1alpha1
kind: TrainJob
metadata:
  name: quick-experiment
spec:
  activeDeadlineSeconds: 28800        # Max runtime: 8 hours
  runtimeRef:
    name: torch-distributed-gpu
  trainer:
    image: my-training:latest
    numNodes: 2
# 8-hour deadline set on TrainJob
```

**TrainJob with activeDeadlineSeconds via SDK (Data Scientist):**

```python
from kubeflow.trainer import TrainerClient, CustomTrainer, Initializer, HuggingFaceDatasetInitializer

TrainerClient().train(
    trainer=CustomTrainer(
        func=train_func,
        num_nodes=3,
    ),
    initializer=Initializer(
        model=HuggingFaceDatasetInitializer(storage_uri="hf://qwen3.2-instruct")
    ),
    active_deadline_seconds=28800,  # 8 hours max
)
```

The `active_deadline_seconds` parameter in the SDK maps to `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` on the created `TrainJob`.

### Implementation Overview

**Controller Changes** (`pkg/controller/trainjob_controller.go`):

1. **Value Resolution:**
    - Read `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` directly from `TrainJobSpec`

2. **Deadline Enforcement:**
    - Check if job is running and effective deadline is set
    - Calculate `deadline = startTime + effectiveActiveDeadlineSeconds` (where `startTime` is reset on each resume from suspension)
    - If exceeded, mark TrainJob as Failed (`Reason: DeadlineExceeded`); the runtime framework handles cleanup of the underlying JobSet
    - Otherwise, requeue at `deadline`

3. **Clock Skew Handling:**
    - If calculated requeue time is in the past (due to clock skew), requeue with a small delay (e.g., 1 second)

### Clock Skew Handling

Kubernetes clusters may experience clock skew between nodes. When calculating requeue times:

- If the calculated `RequeueAfter` duration is negative or zero (due to clock skew or processing delays), the controller requeues with a 1-second delay
- This prevents tight reconciliation loops while ensuring timely processing
- Example: If `deadline` is 10:00:00 but the controller's clock reads 10:00:02, instead of an invalid negative requeue, we wait 1 second and retry

```go
requeueAfter := deadline.Sub(time.Now())
if requeueAfter <= 0 {
    // Clock skew detected, use minimum delay
    requeueAfter = 1 * time.Second
}
return ctrl.Result{RequeueAfter: requeueAfter}, nil
```


### Controller Restart Behavior

The controller is stateless and stores no timers in memory. On restart:

1. Controller-runtime triggers initial sync, reconciling all TrainJobs
2. For each TrainJob, deadlines are recalculated from:
   - The last resume time (or `metadata.creationTimestamp` if never suspended) for deadline calculation
3. If deadline already expired during downtime, action is taken immediately
4. Otherwise, appropriate requeue times are set

This design ensures no TrainJobs are "forgotten" after a controller restart.

**Validation:**

**Field-level CEL markers** on the API types:

- `Minimum=1` on `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` (`TrainJobSpec`)
- `XValidation: self == oldSelf` on `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` (`TrainJobSpec`) - immutable after creation

**Cross-field CEL markers** on `TrainingRuntimeSpec` to prevent conflicting lifecycle fields in the JobSet/Job template:

- `self.template.spec.replicatedJobs.all(rj, !has(rj.template.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds))` - Job-level deadline would terminate pods independently from TrainJob deadline tracking

### Interaction with Suspend

Matching Kubernetes Job behavior (K8s 1.35+ with `MutableSchedulingDirectivesForSuspendedJobs`), the `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` timer is **stopped and reset** when a TrainJob is suspended. When the TrainJob is resumed, the timer **restarts from zero**, giving the job the full `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` duration again.

- If a TrainJob is created in a suspended state, the timer does not start until the TrainJob is first unsuspended
- When a running TrainJob is suspended, the controller clears the internal start time reference. On resume, the start time is reset to the current time, and the full `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` window applies from that point

### Test Plan

[x] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

#### Unit Tests

- `pkg/controller/`: High coverage expected for new logic in `trainjob_controller.go`

**Test Cases:**
- Deadline from TrainJob → enforced
- No deadline set → no enforcement
- Deadline exceeded → job failed with DeadlineExceeded reason
- Deadline not reached → requeue at deadline
- Clock skew → requeue with delay instead of negative duration

#### Integration Tests

- `test/integration/controller/trainjob_controller_test.go`:
    - End-to-end deadline enforcement from TrainJob
    - Suspended TrainJob → deadline timer does not start until first unsuspend
    - Running TrainJob suspended and resumed → deadline timer resets (full duration available again)

#### E2E Tests

- `test/e2e/trainjob_deadline_test.go`:
    - Real training workload with deadline: Verify job fails at timeout with DeadlineExceeded reason
    - Verify no orphaned resources remain

## Future Plan

### TTLSecondsAfterFinished

We postpone the implementation of `TTLSecondsAfterFinished` on the `TrainingRuntimeSpec` to avoid user confusion in the v2.2 release. In a future iteration, we plan to implement it to allow platform admins to configure automatic cleanup policies as defaults for all TrainJobs using a runtime.

## Implementation History

- **2025-10-20**: Issue opened [#2899](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer/issues/2899)
- **2026-01-04**: Initial KEP drafted
- **2026-01-22**: KEP updated with layered API design (TrainJob + TrainingRuntime)
- **TBD**: Alpha implementation


## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Both Fields on TrainJobSpec Only

Put both `TTLSecondsAfterFinished` and `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` only on `TrainJobSpec`.

**Pros:**
- Simpler API surface
- Users have full control

**Cons:**
- No centralized policy enforcement for platform admins
- Data scientists must set TTL on every job
- Difficult to enforce cluster-wide cleanup policies

### Alternative 2: Both Fields on TrainingRuntimeSpec Only

Put both fields only on `TrainingRuntimeSpec`.

**Pros:**
- Centralized control for platform admins
- Consistent policies across all jobs

**Cons:**
- Data scientists cannot customize deadlines for specific jobs
- Less flexible for varying job requirements

### Alternative 3: Add `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` to TrainingRuntimeSpec as Default

Add `ActiveDeadlineSeconds` to `TrainingRuntimeSpec` as a default that individual TrainJobs can override.

**Pros:**
- Platform admins can enforce default deadlines for all jobs
- Data scientists can still override per job

**Cons:**
- Adds complexity to value resolution logic
- Potential user confusion (users may not realize a default deadline exists)

**Decision:** Deferred to a future iteration. If user feedback shows demand for runtime-level default deadlines, this extension can be added without breaking changes.
